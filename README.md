# LatencyRanger ![latencyranger logo](boots.png)
A way to reduce lag and latency while gaming on far away servers.

**PLEASE NOTE** You may have to edit the script's source in order to customize it to your criteria

# How does it work?
Latency ranger first connects to a high speed proxy that is located near you.

Then, that high speed proxy sends and retrieves that information from the game's servers

Last, the data is brought back to you, and latency/lag is reduced

## Why does this work?
Any high speed proxy is always better than an average home connection, so finding one

that is close to you can reduce ping greatly.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/aidensala/latencyranger.git
cd latencyranger/
python latencyranger.py (using 2.7)
```
